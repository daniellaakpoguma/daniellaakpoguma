## ⚡ Fun fact:
When I'm not immersed in code, you'll often find me lost in the pages of a good book. Reading is my escape—a journey into different worlds, ideas, and perspectives. It not only fuels my imagination but also enhances my problem-solving skills, which I love applying to coding challenges. Apart from coding and reading, I am also a film and series enthusiast. I enjoy exploring diverse genres and storytelling techniques on the screen.
