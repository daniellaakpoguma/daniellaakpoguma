## ⚡ Fun fact:
When I'm not immersed in code, you'll often find me lost in the pages of a good book. Reading is my escape—a journey into different worlds, ideas, and perspectives. It not only fuels my imagination but also enhances my problem-solving skills, which I love applying to coding challenges. Apart from coding and reading, I am also a film and series enthusiast. I enjoy exploring diverse genres and storytelling techniques on the screen.

## 🌟 Future Goals
As I chart my course toward becoming a data analsyt, I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. I envision myself contributing to innovative projects, collaborating with like-minded individuals, and making a positive impact through technology.

Let's connect and share our journeys in this dynamic world of code and creativity! 🚀
