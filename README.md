## ABOUT ME 😄 🤍 
👋 Hi there! I'm a student in Computing Science & Business Administration at Saint Mary's University, passionate about technology, business, problem-solving, and innovation. I'm currently honing my skills in various data analysis tools and frameworks, including Python, R, and more. My focus is on building a strong foundation in  data analysis, machine learning, project management, and software development. With a growing interest in data analysis and machine learning, I'm working on building a portfolio that showcases my capabilities in these fields

## 💻 Skills
- **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL, R
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Visualization:** Tableau, Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
- **Database Management:** MySQL, SQLite
- **Tools:** MS Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub

Feel free to explore my repositories to see projects implemented in these languages!

## ⚡ Fun fact:
When I'm not immersed in code, you'll often find me lost in the pages of a good book. Reading is my escape—a journey into different worlds, ideas, and perspectives. It not only fuels my imagination but also enhances my problem-solving skills, which I love applying to coding challenges. Apart from coding and reading, I am also a film and series enthusiast. I enjoy exploring diverse genres and storytelling techniques on the screen.

## 🌟 Future Goals
As I chart my course toward becoming a data analsyt, I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. I envision myself contributing to innovative projects, collaborating with like-minded individuals, and making a positive impact through technology.

Let's connect and share our journeys in this dynamic world of code and creativity! 🚀
